## CRUD Operators
The term "CRUD" refers to the four operations that are thought to be required to develop a persistent storage application: creation, read, update, and delete. It originates from the area of computer programming. Any data storage device, such as a solid-state drive or a hard disc, that keeps power after the device is turned off is referred to as persistent storage.

The CRUD acronym identifies all of the major functions that are inherent to relational databases and the applications used to manage them.
